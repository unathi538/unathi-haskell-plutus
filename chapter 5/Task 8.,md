HC5T8: Point-Free Style



### âœ… **Point-Free Version of `addFive`**

```haskell
-- Point-free style version of addFive
addFive :: Int -> Int
addFive = (+ 5)

-- Main function to test it
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Add 5 to 3:"
    print (addFive 3)   -- Should print 8
    putStrLn "Add 5 to 10:"
    print (addFive 10)  -- Should print 15
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Explanation:

* The original function:

  ```haskell
  addFive x = x + 5
  ```

  is written in **pointed style** (explicitly using a parameter).
* The point-free version removes the parameter and rewrites it as:

  ```haskell
  addFive = (+ 5)
  ```

---

### âœ… **Expected Output:**

```
Add 5 to 3:
8
Add 5 to 10:
15
```
