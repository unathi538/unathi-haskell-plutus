* Defines a `Box a` type with two constructors: `Empty` and `Has a`,
* Defines a type class `WeAccept` with a function `accept :: Box a -> Bool`,
* Implements a `WeAccept` instance for `Box a` (accepts non-empty boxes),
* Implements a function `acceptedBoxes :: [Box a] -> [Box a]` to return only accepted boxes,
* Demonstrates everything in `main`.

---

### ‚úÖ Full Working Example

```haskell
-- Define the Box type
data Box a = Empty | Has a deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Define the WeAccept type class
class WeAccept a where
  accept :: a -> Bool

-- Implement WeAccept for Box a
instance WeAccept (Box a) where
  accept Empty   = False
  accept (Has _) = True

-- Function to return only accepted boxes
acceptedBoxes :: WeAccept a => [a] -> [a]
acceptedBoxes = filter accept

-- Main function to demonstrate usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let boxes = [Has 10, Empty, Has 42, Empty, Has 0]
  putStrLn "Original list of boxes:"
  print boxes

  let accepted = acceptedBoxes boxes
  putStrLn "\nAccepted boxes:"
  print accepted
```

### üîç Explanation

* `Box a` is a simple container that may or may not contain a value.
* `WeAccept` is a type class with a single method `accept`, deciding if a value is acceptable.
* The instance `WeAccept (Box a)` accepts only `Has _` and rejects `Empty`.
* `acceptedBoxes` filters a list to keep only accepted boxes.
* `main` shows how it all works.

### üí° Sample Output

```
Original list of boxes:
[Has 10,Empty,Has 42,Empty,Has 0]

Accepted boxes:
[Has 10,Has 42,Has 0]
```
