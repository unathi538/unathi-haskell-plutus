### Steps:

1. Define the `Tree` data type.
2. Implement the `Functor` instance for `Tree`.
3. Provide a `main` function that creates a tree, applies `fmap`, and prints the results.

### Code with explanation:

```haskell
-- Define a binary tree data type
data Tree a = Empty
            | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
            deriving (Show)

-- Make Tree an instance of Functor
instance Functor Tree where
  fmap _ Empty = Empty
  fmap f (Node x left right) = Node (f x) (fmap f left) (fmap f right)

-- Example usage in main
main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Create a sample tree
  let tree = Node 1 
                (Node 2 Empty Empty) 
                (Node 3 (Node 4 Empty Empty) Empty)
  
  putStrLn "Original tree:"
  print tree
  
  -- Use fmap to increment each value in the tree
  let incrementedTree = fmap (+1) tree
  
  putStrLn "Tree after fmap (+1):"
  print incrementedTree
```

### Explanation:

* `Tree` can be either `Empty` (a leaf) or a `Node` with a value and two subtrees.
* The `Functor` instance defines how to map a function over every element in the tree.
* For `Empty`, `fmap` does nothing.
* For `Node x left right`, `fmap` applies the function to `x` and recursively applies `fmap` to `left` and `right`.
* In `main`, we create a tree of integers, print it, then use `fmap` to add 1 to every element and print the new tree.
