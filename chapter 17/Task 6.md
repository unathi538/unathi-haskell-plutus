This requires that the `Severity` type is a **Monoid**, where:

* `(<>)` returns the higher severity (via `max`).
* `mempty` is `Low` (the identity).

## ‚úÖ Full Working Code

```haskell
-- Define the Severity data type
data Severity = Low | Medium | High | Critical
  deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)

-- Semigroup instance: higher severity wins
instance Semigroup Severity where
  (<>) = max

-- Monoid instance: identity is Low
instance Monoid Severity where
  mempty = Low

-- Combine a list of severities using mconcat to find the highest
maxSeverity :: [Severity] -> Severity
maxSeverity = mconcat

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let severities1 = [Low, Medium, High]
      severities2 = [Low, Low]
      severities3 = [Medium, Critical, High, Medium]

  putStrLn "Combining severities using maxSeverity:"
  putStrLn $ "maxSeverity [Low, Medium, High] = " ++ show (maxSeverity severities1)
  putStrLn $ "maxSeverity [Low, Low] = " ++ show (maxSeverity severities2)
  putStrLn $ "maxSeverity [Medium, Critical, High, Medium] = " ++ show (maxSeverity severities3)
```

## üîç Explanation

### ‚úÖ `Severity` Type

We define 4 severity levels:

```haskell
Low < Medium < High < Critical
```

This order comes from deriving `Ord`.

### ‚úÖ Semigroup Instance

```haskell
instance Semigroup Severity where
  (<>) = max
```

Combines two `Severity` values and keeps the higher one.

### ‚úÖ Monoid Instance

```haskell
instance Monoid Severity where
  mempty = Low
```

The identity is `Low`, meaning combining with `Low` doesn't change the result.

### ‚úÖ `maxSeverity` Function

```haskell
maxSeverity = mconcat
```

Uses the `Monoid` to reduce a list of severities to a single `Severity` (i.e. the maximum).
